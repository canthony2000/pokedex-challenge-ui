# Pokédex Challenge – UI

## Technologies

- Apollo Client (https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)
- GraphQL (https://graphql.org/graphql-js/)
- Material UI (https://material-ui.com/)
- Reach Router (https://reach.tech/router)
- Downshift (https://www.npmjs.com/package/downshift)
- Styled Components (https://www.styled-components.com/)
- Lodash (https://lodash.com/)
- ESLint (https://eslint.org/)
- Prettier (https://prettier.io/)

## Running the UI

1. From your terminal, navigate to the `ui` directory
1. Enter `npm i` into your terminal to install the dependencies
1. Enter `npm start` into your terminal to run the dev server
1. The UI will now be accessible at http://localhost:3000

## Changing the Port

If you want the dev server to run on a different port, prefix the npm start command with a PORT variable:

```
PORT=5000 npm start
```
