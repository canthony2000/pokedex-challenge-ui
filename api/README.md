# Pokédex Challenge – API

## Technologies

- Apollo Server (https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/)
- GraphQL (https://graphql.org/graphql-js/)
- Lodash (https://lodash.com/)
- ESLint (https://eslint.org/)
- Prettier (https://prettier.io/)

## Running the API

1. From your terminal, navigate to the `api` directory
1. Enter `npm i` into your terminal to install the dependencies
1. Enter `npm start` into your terminal to run the dev server
1. The API will now be accessible at http://localhost:4000

## Changing the Port

If you want the dev server to run on a different port, prefix the npm start command with a PORT variable:

```
PORT=5000 npm start
```
